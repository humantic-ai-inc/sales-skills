# Sales Skills

Prompts for sellers using Humantic AI through an AI assistant. Built for **Microsoft Copilot**, **Claude** and **ChatGPT**.

Every prompt here is written to be pasted as-is. Swap in the bracketed detail and send. No prompt asks you to know a tool name, a parameter, or what DISC stands for.

Each prompt sits in a grey box. Hover over the box and a **copy button** appears in its top-right corner: click it, paste into your assistant, then replace anything in [square brackets] with the real name or company. The line breaks you see in the box do not matter, paste them as they are.

## Skills

Seven installable skills that turn the prompts below into complete workflows. You ask in your own words, for example "prep me for my meeting with Acme tomorrow", and the matching skill takes over.

| Skill | What it does |
| :--- | :--- |
| [buyer-read](skills/buyer-read/) | How one person communicates, what drives them, and how to approach them |
| [meeting-prep](skills/meeting-prep/) | A one-page brief built around what the meeting has to produce |
| [pursuit-plan](skills/pursuit-plan/) | A plan for winning one named account |
| [prospecting](skills/prospecting/) | Who to work this week, with a reason attached to every name |
| [sales-email](skills/sales-email/) | Emails matched to the person reading them |
| [buying-committee](skills/buying-committee/) | Maps the people who decide and how to move them as a group |
| [expansion-play](skills/expansion-play/) | What an existing customer should buy next, and when to ask |

**Install in Claude:** add this repo as a plugin marketplace, or upload any skill folder under Settings, Skills. **ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot:** upload the skill folders as skills, or see the admin guide from your Humantic contact.

## Prompts

**New here? Start with [SETUP.md](SETUP.md)** to connect Humantic to your assistant, then come back to the index below.

## How to use these

**One identifier per person.** Give a LinkedIn URL *or* an email, never both in the same request. There is no linking step, so if you want both to work later, ask for each separately.

**Ask for the format you want.** If you want something you can share or print, say so in the prompt rather than relying on the default.

**Your other tools make these better, and none of them are required.** If your assistant can see your calendar, mail, CRM, meeting notes or files, these prompts use them. If it cannot, it asks you for what would help. If you would rather not share anything, you still get the best read Humantic alone can give. See [CONNECTORS.md](CONNECTORS.md) for what each connector adds and where.

## Two things to know before you rely on this

**A personality read is a guide, not a verdict.** It tells you how to approach someone. It does not tell you whether a deal will close, and it belongs alongside what you already know rather than in place of it. This matters most in the buying-committee prompts, where the value is in spotting a pattern worth checking rather than in treating the read as settled.

**Section 09 needs at least one other tool connected.** Those prompts combine Humantic with your calendar, mail, CRM or files, so they depend on what your assistant can reach. Everything in sections 01 to 08 and 10 works with Humantic alone.
